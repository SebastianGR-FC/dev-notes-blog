# Vintage Hacker Styling

Spent time getting the visual aesthetic right. The goal is to evoke that classic hacker/developer vibe from the 80s and 90s, but with modern web standards.

## Color Palette

- Background: `#0d1117` (very dark blue-gray)
- Text: `#c9d1d9` (light gray)
- Headers: `#f0883e` (orange, like old terminal highlights)
- Links: `#58a6ff` (blue)
- Code: `#d2a8ff` (purple)
- Borders: `#30363d` (subtle gray)

This is inspired by GitHub's dark theme but with more contrast and that retro feel.

## Typography

Using `Courier New`, `Monaco`, `Menlo` - classic monospace fonts. The line-height is set to 1.6 for readability, which is important when you're reading code-heavy content.

## Layout

Simple, clean layout. No fancy animations or transitions. Just content-focused. The notes list uses cards with subtle borders that highlight on hover.

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting would be nice, but for now keeping it simple with just styled code blocks. The vintage aesthetic doesn't need too much polish.
